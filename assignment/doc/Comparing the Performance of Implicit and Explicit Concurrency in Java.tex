\chapter{Introduction}
In order to compare the effects of concurrency in Java on performance, A test program was created that compared various implementations of concurrency, implicit and explicit, to two baseline non-concurrent implementations. These implementations performed a number of mathematical operations on a set of integers derived from the user inputting a start and end integer at launch. These operations consisted of finding all the prime numbers in the set, finding all the factors of the end integer in the set, finding all the mersenne numbers in the set and finding all the perfect numbers in the set. Within this program, time recorded in nano seconds was used as a benchmark in order to compare these implementations to each other. Although there are other variables that could be used in conjunction that may give a more detailed result, time will give us clear and simple results to draw conclusions from. The time was taken before and after each implementation ran over the set and then each total run time was derived llslsfrom them. In order to compare them easily, a ratio derived from the total times of the baseline implementations and concurrent implementation is outputted to a csv file per set of numbers.
